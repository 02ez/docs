# ADR-001: DevOps Security and CI/CD Pipeline Hardening

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The GitHub Docs repository requires comprehensive DevOps security hardening to meet enterprise-grade security and reliability standards. This includes implementing supply chain security, performance monitoring, migration safety, and deployment automation with appropriate safeguards.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive DevOps security framework with the following components:

### 1. Supply Chain Security
- **SBOM Generation**: Implemented automated software bill of materials generation with cryptographic attestations
- **Dependency Scanning**: Enhanced dependency review workflows with security vulnerability detection
- **Provenance Attestation**: Added signed build provenance for all artifacts

### 2. Performance Monitoring and SLO Management
- **Hot Path Benchmarking**: Implemented performance benchmarks for critical paths (content parsing, API responses, search queries)
- **SLO Thresholds**: Defined service level objectives with automated regression detection
- **Memory Management**: Added memory usage monitoring and bounds checking

### 3. Migration Safety and Reliability
- **Idempotency Validation**: All migration operations are guaranteed to be idempotent
- **Rollback Capability**: Full rollback automation for all migration operations
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Comprehensive checksums and validation for migrated data

### 4. Security Hardening
- **Workflow Permissions**: Enforced minimal permissions principle across all CI/CD workflows
- **Concurrency Controls**: Implemented proper concurrency controls to prevent race conditions
- **Secret Management**: Enhanced secret scanning and baseline management

### 5. Code Quality and Compliance
- **TypeScript Validation**: Fixed compilation errors and enforced strict typing
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites for security, performance, and migration scenarios
- **Code Ownership**: Updated CODEOWNERS to require security team review for critical components

## Implementation Details

### Security Workflows Enhanced
- `security-scanning.yml`: Advanced security scanning with proper permissions
- `sbom-provenance.yml`: SBOM generation with cryptographic attestations  
- `dependency-review.yml`: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- `codeql.yml`: Code analysis with security-events write permissions

### Test Infrastructure
- **Security Hardening Tests**: Validates workflow configurations and permissions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated SLO compliance testing with regression detection
- **Migration Validation**: Comprehensive idempotency and rollback testing

### Configuration Files
- Enhanced CODEOWNERS with security-critical file protections
- Isolated vitest configurations for different test types
- Strict TypeScript compilation with proper error handling

## Rationale

This comprehensive approach addresses multiple critical requirements:

1. **Security Compliance**: Meets enterprise security standards with supply chain protection
2. **Operational Excellence**: Ensures reliable deployments with proper safeguards
3. **Performance Assurance**: Prevents performance regressions through automated monitoring
4. **Data Integrity**: Protects against data loss during migrations and deployments
5. **Code Quality**: Maintains high standards through automated validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly improved security posture with supply chain protection
- Automated performance regression detection
- Safe, reversible migration operations
- Enhanced code quality and maintainability
- Clear ownership and review requirements for critical components

### Negative
- Increased CI/CD pipeline complexity
- Additional test execution time
- More stringent review requirements may slow some development

### Mitigation Strategies
- Isolated test configurations to minimize impact on development workflows
- Clear documentation and training for new processes
- Gradual rollout with monitoring and feedback collection

## Related Decisions

This ADR relates to ongoing efforts to:
- Modernize the docs infrastructure
- Improve security and compliance posture  
- Enhance operational reliability
- Maintain high code quality standards
