# GitHub Actions Security Hardening Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security hardening measures implemented for the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Action Security
- **Pinned Action SHAs**: All third-party actions are pinned to full-length commit SHAs instead of tags
- **First-party Actions**: GitHub-owned actions use semantic versioning (v4, v5) as they are more trusted
- **SHA Validation**: Automated tests ensure all actions are properly pinned

### 2. Workflow Permissions
- **Least Privilege**: All workflows use minimal permissions (contents:read by default)
- **Specific Permissions**: Security workflows only get required permissions:
  - `security-events: write` for uploading SARIF results
  - `id-token: write` for OIDC attestations
  - `attestations: write` for SBOM/provenance
- **No Broad Permissions**: Eliminated use of `write-all` or wildcard permissions

### 3. New Security Workflows

#### Dependency Review (`dependency-review.yml`)
- Scans PRs for vulnerable dependencies
- Blocks moderate+ severity vulnerabilities
- Enforces license compliance
- Auto-comments on PRs with findings

#### Security Scanning (`security-scanning.yml`)
- Trivy filesystem and configuration scanning
- Daily automated scans
- SARIF uploads to GitHub Security tab
- Comprehensive vulnerability detection

#### SBOM & Provenance (`sbom-provenance.yml`)
- Generates Software Bill of Materials with Syft
- SLSA provenance attestation
- Artifact signing and verification
- Supply chain transparency

#### Pre-commit (`pre-commit.yml`)
- Comprehensive linting (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Security scanning (detect-secrets, Trivy)
- Shell script validation (shellcheck)
- YAML/Docker linting

#### Auto-merge (`auto-merge.yml`)
- Automatic PR merging when all checks pass
- Requires code owner approval
- Validates all required status checks
- Safety mechanisms against malicious changes

### 4. Repository Configuration

#### Branch Protection (see `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`)
- Required status checks for all security workflows
- Code owner reviews required
- Up-to-date branch enforcement
- Signed commits requirement
- Force push protection

#### Concurrency Controls
- All critical workflows have concurrency controls
- Prevents race conditions
- Resource optimization
- Cancels redundant runs

### 5. Security Tools Integration

#### Pre-commit Hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- Multi-language linting (JavaScript, Python, Shell, YAML, Docker)
- Security scanning (detect-secrets, Trivy)
- Automated formatting and validation
- Runs locally and in CI

#### Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Automated dependency updates
- GitHub Actions version updates
- Security patch automation
- Grouped updates for efficiency

### 6. Artifact Security
- 7-day retention policy for all artifacts
- SBOM and security scan results preserved
- Signed artifacts with attestations
- Immutable artifact references

### 7. Environment Hardening
- Ubuntu runners only (no self-hosted)
- Minimal container images
- OIDC for cloud authentication
- Environment protection rules

## üß™ Validation & Testing

### Automated Tests (`src/workflows/tests/security-hardening.ts`)
- Validates all security workflows exist
- Checks for minimal permissions
- Verifies action SHA pinning
- Confirms artifact retention policies
- Tests concurrency controls

### Validation Script (`scripts/validate-security.sh`)
- Comprehensive security checklist
- Automated validation of all requirements
- Can be run locally or in CI
- Reports on compliance status

## üöÄ Usage

### Running Security Validation
```bash
# Run the comprehensive validation script
./scripts/validate-security.sh

# Run just the workflow tests
npm run test -- workflows
```

### Setting up Pre-commit
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Manual Security Checks
```bash
# Check for unpinned actions
grep -r "@v[0-9]" .github/workflows/ | grep -v "# v" | grep -v "# pin"

# Check for broad permissions
grep -r "permissions:" .github/workflows/ | grep -E "(write-all|\\*)"

# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/

# Security scan with Trivy
trivy fs --format table --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
```
