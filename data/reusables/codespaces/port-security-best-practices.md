When configuring port forwarding for your dev container, consider these security best practices:

- **Use private or organization-only visibility by default**: Avoid automatically setting ports to public unless necessary for your specific use case
- **Forward only required ports**: Only include ports in `forwardPorts` that are essential for development and testing
- **Use descriptive labels**: Configure port labels using `portsAttributes` to help team members understand each port's purpose
- **Leverage organization policies**: Work with your organization administrators to establish port visibility policies that align with your security requirements
- **Review automation commands**: When using `postAttachCommand` for port visibility automation, ensure the visibility settings match your security needs

Example of a security-focused port configuration:

```jsonc
"forwardPorts": [3000, 8080],
"portsAttributes": {
  "3000": {
    "label": "Dev Server (Private)",
    "protocol": "http"
  },
  "8080": {
    "label": "API Server (Team Only)",  
    "protocol": "http"
  }
},
"postAttachCommand": "gh cs ports visibility 3000:private 8080:org -c \"$CODESPACE_NAME\""
```
