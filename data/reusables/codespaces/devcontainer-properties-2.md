* **postCreateCommand:** Use this property to run commands after your codespace is created. This can be formatted as a string (as above), an array, or an object. For more information, see the [dev containers specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/#lifecycle-scripts) on the Development Containers website.
* **postAttachCommand:** Use this property to run commands each time a tool or person attaches to the codespace. This is useful for automating port visibility settings and other per-session configurations.
* **customizations:** This property allows you to customize a specific tool or service when it is used for working in a codespace. For example, you can configure specific settings and extensions for {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}. For more information, see [Supporting tools and services](https://containers.dev/supporting) on the Development Containers website.
* **remoteUser:** By default, youâ€™re running as the vscode user, but you can optionally set this to root.
